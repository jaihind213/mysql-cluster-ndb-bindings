mysql-cluster-ndb-bindings
==========================

NDB bindings for MySQL Cluster. 
The source code is from 
https://launchpad.net/ndb-bindings. 

Description:
------------
NDB/Bindings is a project concerned with providing wrappers to the C++ NDBAPI. 
These connectors aim to allow low-level programmatic access to MySQL Cluster, also know as NDB, from various programming languages. 
Hopefully, once the doors are opened to the NDBAPI for people outside of the C++ world, many new and exciting ideas might emerge.

Important Note: I am not the author of the source code which has been taken from launchPad.

I made a fix to it to make it work with mysql cluster 7.3
